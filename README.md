As far as technologies that were used in the creation of this app...we used information from newsapi.org for the real meat and potatoes of the app. This API pulls content from over 5,000 sources. 

Youâ€™ll also see the random quote when you load the page. These are funny or inspiring thoughts that we think will appeal to our audience.

This app also utilizes Firebase which keeps track of the number of users on the screen. Plus, we have color gradients to make the design stand out.

Collaborators for this project are Emily Bird, Troy Moling and AJ Patel.

Trend 5: your day starts here.
